# hello-world
My first repository

Howdy, I'm a Materials Engineer by day and a Triathlete by night.  I love the outdoors especially if I'm out in the mountains exploring.
The majority of my spare time goes into triathlon, either training or coaching; I'm trying to make a career of it, but realize that's a bit of a long shot.
